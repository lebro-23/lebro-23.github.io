        			<h2>Experience<h2>
	        			<h3>Data Scientist, Ensu (San Francisco)</h3>
							<li>Responsible for designing, implementing and managing entire data science pipeline from Survey Design & Data Collection to ETL, Modeling & Deployment</li>
							<li>Built deep learning ensemble consisting of autoencoder + classifier using Tensorflow, iteratively achieving more than 300% uplift in accuracy over initial rules based prediction system</li>
							<li>Building and implementing ensemble recommender system consisting of collaborative filtering/matrix factorization + autoencoder combined with clustering</li>
							<li>Working closely with Product to create metrics for retention, flow and funnel analysis and automating this through Mixpanel integration with BigQuery and R</li>
	        			<h3>Analyst (Data Science) - Rest (Sydney)</h3>
							<li>Provided comprehensive churn analysis of customer base using visual data analysis, feature selection and a combination of machine learning (XGBoost, Random Forest) and statistical (Lasso, Logistic Regression) models. Identified leading ‘triggers’ that are highly indicative of churn and could potentially save more than $100 million</li>
