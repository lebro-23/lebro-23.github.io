        			<h2>Education<h2>
        				<h3>University of Sydney – BSc – Mathematics & Computer Science (Mar 2014 – Nov 2017<h3>
        			<h2>Experience<h2>
	        			<h3>Data Scientist, Ensu (San Francisco)</h3>
							<li>Responsible for designing, implementing and managing entire data science pipeline from Survey Design & Data Collection to ETL, Modeling & Deployment</li>
							<li>Built deep learning ensemble consisting of autoencoder + classifier using Tensorflow, iteratively achieving more than 300% uplift in accuracy over initial rules based prediction system</li>
							<li>Building and implementing ensemble recommender system consisting of collaborative filtering/matrix factorization + autoencoder combined with clustering</li>
							<li>Working closely with Product to create metrics for retention, flow and funnel analysis and automating this through Mixpanel integration with BigQuery and R</li>
							<li>Decreasing load times by 400% by combining existing backend Django code into highly optimized SQL</li>
							<li>Building social media scrapers + bots to collect data and carry out different actions, helping increase our Instagram followers by 800% and generating leads for 10,000 + potential TikTok influencers</li>
							<li>Setting up backend framework to pull data from APIs and load into database using Celery and Django</li>
	        			<h3>Analyst (Data Science) - Rest (Sydney)</h3>
							<li>Provided comprehensive churn analysis of customer base using visual data analysis, feature selection and a combination of machine learning (XGBoost, Random Forest) and statistical (Lasso, Logistic Regression) models. Identified leading ‘triggers’ that are highly indicative of churn and could potentially save more than $100 million</li>
							<li>Used customer address information to geo-code addresses. Combined this with census data to add 100+ geo-demographic features for use in modeling.</li>
						<h3>Analyst, Client Analytics (Data Science) – Equifax (Sydney)</h3>
							<li>Used clustering algorithm to create custom spatial subdivisions for segmentation for fast food retailer – provided 50 site recommendations that contributed to 25% increase in EBITDA for European region</li>
							<li>Created and deployed multinomial linear regression model to develop custom weighting scheme for polling released to media through ReachTel platform, worth over $100,000</li>
							<li>Developed solution worth $200,000 for major party - modelled a variety of issues using machine-learning methods (XGBoost) and provided insights through a complex Tableau dashboard</li>
							<li>Created complex Tableau visualisation for financial provider to analyse the credit behaviour of their customers– provided an intuitive socio-demographic analysis of high risk customers worth $10 million</li>
							<li>Contributed to process improvement by writing Spark and PowerShell code to automate standard analytical procedures for my team - Removed inefficiencies in common processes by utilising internal big data platform</li>
							<li>Used variety of time series models (ARIMA/ARIMAX, LSTM, prophet) to forecast future credit demand</li>
